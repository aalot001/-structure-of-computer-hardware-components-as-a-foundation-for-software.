Homework 4.43:

If we substitute %esp for REG in the code sequence we get:

	subl $4,%esp     Decrement stack pointer 
	movl %esp, (%esp) Store

	
	# which would imply that the decremented version of the stack pointer would be stored on the stack, which we know is not the case:

	
	# and will return zero as movl%esp,(%esp) instruction will store the same value stored on the top of the stack.
